Build a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Data Website UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The design should be visually appealing, modern, and optimized for data-heavy analytics. The website should have a dark mode option for better readability. It should feature a clean, interactive dashboard with multiple sections.

The homepage should welcome users with a hero section displaying key FPL insights, like top-performing players, captain picks, and upcoming fixtures. It should have a search bar to find players, teams, or stats quickly.

The navigation bar (sticky at the top) should include the following links:

Home (Main dashboard)
Player Stats (Detailed player statistics)
Team Insights (Team form, upcoming fixtures, and win probabilities)
Fixtures & Schedule (Upcoming matches, fixture difficulty ranking)
AI Recommendations (Best captain choices, differentials, and transfer suggestions)
Live Updates (Live match data and real-time FPL points tracking)
Community & Leaderboards (Mini-league rankings and discussions)
The dashboard should contain:

Top Players of the Week (Cards with player name, club, points, xG/xA, and a small form graph)
Fixture Difficulty Chart (A visual graph ranking teams based on ease of fixtures)
Price Change Tracker (Players rising or falling in value)
Injury & Suspension Alerts (A notification panel for important team news)
Best Differential Picks (Low-owned players with high upside)
The Player Stats Page should have:

A search bar to find players by name or team
A table showing Points, Price, xG, xA, Form, Ownership %
Filters for Position (GK, DEF, MID, FWD), Price Range, Team, and Ownership %
A comparison tool to analyze two players side by side
The Team Insights Page should include:

A heatmap of recent performance
A form table with Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, Clean Sheet Probability
Fixture difficulty for the next 5 gameweeks
The AI Recommendations Page should provide:

Best Captain Choices (Based on AI analysis)
Best Transfers (Who to buy & sell based on form & fixtures)
Predicted Points for each player
The Live Updates Page should display:


A modern, clean UI with a dark mode toggle
Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
Cards & tables for data visualization
Gradient backgrounds & hover effects for interactive elements
Minimalist typography for readability
The UI should feel like a premium analytics platform, similar to FPL websites like LiveFPL.net and Fantasy Football Scout, but with a more modern and AI-driven touch.
